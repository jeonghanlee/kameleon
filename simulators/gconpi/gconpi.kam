# Data is sent over the serial port at 9600 baud, 8N1.
# The data is reported in comma separated value (CSV) format:
# CPS, #####, CPM, #####, uSv/hr, ###.##, SLOW|FAST|INST
# There are three modes. Normally, the sample period is LONG_PERIOD
# (default 60 seconds). This is SLOW averaging mode. If the last five measured
# counts exceed a preset threshold, the sample period switches to
# SHORT_PERIOD seconds (default 5 seconds). This is FAST mode, and is
# more responsive but less accurate. Finally, if CPS > 255, we report
# CPS*60 and switch to INST mode, since we canâ€™t store data
# in the (8-bit) sample buffer. The largest CPS value that can be displayed is
# 65535, but the largest value that can be stored in the sample buffer is 255.
